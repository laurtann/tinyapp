# TinyApp Project

### Watch it in Action! Tinyapp is Live [Here](https://tinyapp-laurtann.herokuapp.com/urls)

TinyApp is a full stack web application built with Node and Express that allows users to shorten long URLs (Ã  la bit.ly).

Users can register and login. Each user is tracked with a cookie. Only logged in users can create & edit their own links.

This was done as part of Lighthouse Labs Web Development bootcamp over four days and was the first introduction to back-end development. CSS styling was a minor element of this project.
